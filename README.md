Fulhaus image classification model
I have coded both the classification model and the api in the same file Fulhaus1.ipyb.
The CNN model works well providing good prediction accuracies.
The api has a few minor issue, I can fix if given more time.
I couldn't get to building the docker image and implementing CI/CD pipline due to lack of time
Any questions please feel free to ask.
If code isn't working at your end, please contact me as I can show you the working in my end
